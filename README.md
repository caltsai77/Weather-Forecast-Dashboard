# Weather Forecast Dashboard
Created for the SteelHacks 2021 Hackathon ([Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wu1oEwdejWmhVNqcOTEoYzYdub9VaGsz/view?usp=sharing)) 

## Purpose: 
Our project is based off of the NSIN challenge, concerning weather information and getting it to a certain group of people in the most efficient way possible. We turned that into getting basic weather information for anywhere in the US out to the general public in a smooth and simple way.

## What it Does
Simply put, our project gives a bit of basic information (temperature, conditions, wind) to the user for any zip code in the country. The user simply inputs their zip code, and all of their weather information is present for them there. No steps necessary to sort through past or future forecasts, no irrelevant or extraneous information. It is meant for someone who is waking up for the day and wants to see what the weather is like.
